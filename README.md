Data analysis supporting the reporting of The Texas Tribune story, "Almost two years since Kabul fell, a frayed refugee system creates obstacles for Afghans in Texas," https://www.texastribune.org/2023/06/06/texas-afghan-refugees-visa-asylum/

This story covered the challenges Afghan refugees in Texas face as they resettle there. My reporting focused on two families who fled to the United States after the fall of Kabul, and were eligible for special immigrant visas because of their work with the U.S. government. I followed them over a year, and ended up featuring one family in the story. I wanted to tell a more complete picture of the refugee community in Texas, where more refugees have settled than almost any other state. I used data from researchers in Australia and Germany to find the number of Afghans, Iraqis and Vietnamese who have come to Texas as refugees between 1975 and 2018, at times when the United States was involved in wars in their countries. I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to narrow down the data to just those countries, and just the state of Texas, then built charts from that data. The goal was to show the ripple effects of U.S. military campaigns back in Texas, and how the current refugees' challenges are echoes of the past.
